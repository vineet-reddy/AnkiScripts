    "This script uses the Anthropic API to generate example sentences for vocabulary words in an Anki deck, enhancing GRE study by adding example sentences to vocab flashcards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Imports necessary libraries and initializes the Claude API client with the user’s API key, AnkiConnect URL, and Anki deck name.\n",
    "2. **AnkiConnect Functions**:\n",
    "   - `get_notes()`: Fetches note IDs in the specified deck.\n",
    "   - `get_note_info()`: Retrieves details of each note.\n",
    "   - `update_note_fields()`: Updates a note’s field with a generated sentence.\n",
    "3. **Formatting**: `clean_and_bold_sentence()` formats the sentence, bolding the vocabulary word.\n",
    "4. **Main Process**:\n",
    "   - For each note with an empty \"BackAudio\" field, the script sends a request to Claude Sonnet to generate an example sentence for the word in \"FrontText\".\n",
    "   - The formatted sentence is then added to the note’s \"BackAudio\" field.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process automates the creation of example sentences, adding contextual learning to Anki GRE vocab cards."
